## Android Vigo Study Group #2

This project is focused on supporting the second meeting of the Android Study Group by [GDG Vigo](http://gdgvigo.com/)

### Connecting to the cloud

The concepts discussed in this session are similar to those covered by the [lesson two](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud853#lesson-2-connect-sunshine-to-the-cloud) Udacity Course: [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853)

In this project the concepts to learn are how to add permissions to your app, AsyncTask, learn about the network input & oputput, difference the main UI thread and the background threads, common libraries to make the job easier.

### Sample Application

The application stored in this repository shows different ways to make a request to a server and consume the data coming back in a JSON format.

Specifically, the request is made to a public API that shows different memes and emotions provided by [All The Rage Faces](http://alltheragefaces.com/) site.

- [Api documentation](http://alltheragefaces.com/api)  
- [Endpoint used on the sample](http://alltheragefaces.com/api/all/faces)

### Tags

The Git repository is divided into different tags to make it easier to explain the different concepts. You can move easily through the repository with the command `git checkout {tag}`.

**Clean project** 
`git checkout start`

Clean project generated by Android Studio creating an empty project.


**HTTP Request** 
`git checkout http_request`

A request is made to the API endpoint with an `HttpUrlConnection` object and the response is printed on the console in a JSON format.


**Parsing the response** 
`git checkout parsing_json`

The JSON response is now parsed into a list of entities


**Showing the result into a ListView**
`git checkout meme_listview`

Show the meme titles in a ListView with a simple `ArrayAdapter` with a layout provided by the Android Framework

**Custom adapter**
`git checkout custom_adapter`

Changed simple `ArrayAdapter` by a custom adapter with a layout containing an `ImageView`, a `TexView` for the title and a `TextView` with the meme emotion

**Downloading meme images with Picasso**
`git checkout picasso`

Added the Picasso library to download the meme images from the meme list into the `ListView` adapter.

**Using GSON to parse the response JSON** 
`git checkout gson`

Added & implemented the Gson library to parse the json response in an easier way

**Added Ion libary**

Added & implemented the Ion library to ask the meme api in an easier way, also replacing the Picasso libary
